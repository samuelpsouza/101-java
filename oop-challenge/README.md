Write a program in Java to simulate an ecosystem containing two types of creatures: bears, and fish. The ecosystem consists of a river, which is modeled as a relatively large vector (at least 100 elements). Each element of the vector can be a Bear, a Fish, or null. To do this, fill in the text randomly. In each time interval, based on a random process, each animal tries to move to an adjacent position of the vector (right or left) or stay where it is. If two animals of the same type are about to collide in the same cell, then they stay where they are, but they must create a new instance of their same animal type, which must be placed in a random empty cell (i.e., which was previously null). If a Bear and a Fish collide, the fish dies (that is, it disappears from the vector) and, if it is the fish that is moving, the bear remains where it is, otherwise (bear in movement) the bear must assume the position of the fish. The simulation ends when there are no more fish in the river. To create this simulation you must create the following classes, add the attributes you give necessary to them, and define inheritance relationships between them: Animal, Bear, and Fish.
