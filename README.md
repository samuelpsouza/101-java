# 101-Java

This is a personal repository where I learn and review topics in Java. It contains a collection of self-contained modules and code samples covering core language features, advanced topics, and practical exercises.

## Project Structure

- **java-generics/**  
  Examples and exercises on Java Generics, demonstrating type safety and generic programming patterns.

- **java-metamodels/**  
  Exploration of Java metamodels, annotations, and reflection. Includes custom annotation processing and simple ORM concepts.

- **java-method-handle/**  
  Code samples using the Java Method Handle API for dynamic method invocation and advanced reflection.

- **java-modules/**  
  Demonstrates Java Platform Module System (JPMS) with modularized code, including domain and service modules.

- **java-reflection-api/**  
  Practical examples of Java Reflection API, including class inspection, field/method access, and dynamic instantiation.

- **oop-challenge/**  
  Object-Oriented Programming challenge with animal classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.

- **tdd-with-java/**  
  Test-Driven Development (TDD) exercises in Java, including unit tests and simple banking domain logic.

- **threads/**  
  Multithreading and concurrency examples in Java.

## Getting Started

Each subproject is self-contained. To build and run a module:

1. Navigate to the desired subproject directory (e.g., `cd java-generics`).
2. If the subproject uses Maven, run:
   ```sh
   mvn clean install
   ```
3. Run the main class using your IDE or Maven (e.g., `mvn exec:java`).

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher
- Maven (for Maven-based subprojects)
